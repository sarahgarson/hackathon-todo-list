# ToDoLister

It is a desktop app that is designed to provide users with the ability to create customized todo lists.

While there already exists apps to create todo lists, this one offers more conveinence to the user by making tasks that are searchable by keywords and filterable by date.

In order to run the app, a user would need to register and then login with a username and password. This would mean it is completely browser based and does not need to be installed on a computer. Anyone with access to a browser would be able to run it.
